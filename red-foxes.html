                Red foxes do not always have a rusty red-orange coat. There is a number of different genetic factors
                (which are called morphs) in red foxes that impact the colour of their fur, similar to how eye colour is
                determined. These morphs can range from brown coats all the way through to a silver coloring.
            </li>

                Red foxes can make up to 40 distinct sounds that they use to communicate with eachother.
            </li>
            <li>
                The silver morph of red foxes are semi-domesticated and are sometimes kept as pets.
