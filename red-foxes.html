        <h3>Major Subspecies</h3>
        <p>
            Red foxes are the largest of all the true fox species as well as the most widespread, being found everywhere in the Northern Hemisphere as well as parts of North Africa, Asia and Australia where they have been introduced and are considered an invasive species.

               Red foxes do not always have a rusty red-orange coat. There is a number of different genetic factors (which are called morphs) in red foxes that impact the colour of their fur, similar to how eye colour is determined. These morphs can range from brown coats all the way through to a silver coloring.

                The silver morph of red foxes are semi-domesticated and are sometimes kept as pets.
