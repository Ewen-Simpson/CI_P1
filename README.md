### Colors

Colors used for this project;

- #ff8b3d: used as the dominant site colour for the navbar, heading text and list markers.
- #e7e7e7: used for the logo and for text
- #1b1313: used for the pages to break up text

The colours used for this project were chosen for two reasons. The first is that these colours strongly contrast with each other that contributes to the accessability and readability of the site, and the second reason is that these colours are strongly associated with foxes and helps tie the site's content together to it's theme.

The <div> element on each page has been given a semi-transparent background so as not to break up the background entirely, but at the same time allow for easy readability.

### Species-specific pages

There is 3 species-specific pages for each of the three featured species: arctic foxes, red foxes and fennec foxes. Each page has a large central image of a member of the fox species as well as 3 quick facts and a brief explanation of where they can be found. 

A link can be found at the bottom of each page to the Wikipedia article of each species for further information.
  
### Possible future features
  
In the future, it might be possible to add information for all 12 of the true fox species. More information could be provided, as well as technologies such as javascript implemented for a more interactive experience.
