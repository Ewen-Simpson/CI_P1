              Like red foxes, arctic foxes have morphs, but unlike red foxes they have only two; white and blue. The white morph of the arctic fox has seasonal camouflage as it's coat changes from all white in the winter to brown and grey in the summer.

                Arctic foxes have the warmest coat of any animal in the arctic, allowing them to survive temperatures as low as -70c with their coat alone. This is even higher than polar bears.
